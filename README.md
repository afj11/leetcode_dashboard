# Leetcode Dashboard
Leetcode is a great website for practicing interview questions, but their statistics are lacking, and finding good questions to work on can also be a challenge.  This project scapes submission data from a users account and generates detailed statistics and recommends questions tailored to their needs.
# How to install
When using flask it is good to used a [virtual envirorment](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/), so after setting up a virtual envirornment, pip install requiments.txt.  Then download a [chrome driver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads) to run the headless browser.  This [link](https://help.zenplanner.com/hc/en-us/articles/204253654-How-to-Find-Your-Internet-Browser-Version-Number-Google-Chrome) describes how to find the current version of chrome you have installed, and what consequently what version of the driver you need to install.
# How to use it
Once you get it running, you can open the flask page in your web browser.  Then you need to enter your leetcode password and username, and don't worry, this is all local to your machine.  Then in the background a browser will open, and sign into your account and start scapining your submissoion data.  Then the flask page will update to include statistics on your submissions and a graphical display of that data.
